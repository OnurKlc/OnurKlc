### Hi there! 👋

I'm a Frontend Developer who loves building things.

- 🎯 I enjoy solving problems and making web apps faster and smoother.
- 🛠️ I like learning new technologies, even if I have no idea what I'm doing at first.
- ☕ I drink way too much tea while coding.
- 🎣 I'm trying to get better at fishing, but the fish seem to be smarter than me.
- 📈 I'm interested in finance and sometimes try to predict market trends (mostly fail!).

Always happy to collaborate on cool projects!
